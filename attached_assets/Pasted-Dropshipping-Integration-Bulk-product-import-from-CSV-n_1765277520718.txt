📊 COMPLETE DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS
AGORA vs ZOOM - Do You Need Both?
NO, you don't need Zoom if you're using Agora. Here's the comparison:

Feature	Agora (You Have)	Zoom
HD Video Calls	✅ Built (720p/1080p)	✅
Screen Sharing	✅ Built	✅
Audio/Video Mute	✅ Built	✅
Token Renewal	✅ Built	N/A
Embedded in Your App	✅ Yes	❌ Redirects users
Your Branding	✅ Yes	❌ Zoom branding
Cost	Pay per minute	Pay per host
My Recommendation: Remove Zoom dependency and fully use Agora. Your agoraService.ts is well-built with HD calls, screen sharing, and proper event handling. You just need to:

Configure AGORA_APP_ID and AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE
Build token generation on backend
DOMAIN SYSTEM - What's Built vs Not
Feature	Status
Subdomain generation	✅ Built - mybusiness.kreateyo.com
Custom domain adding	✅ Built - API endpoints exist
DNS verification (A/CNAME)	✅ Built - domainService.js

Primary domain switching	✅ Built
Wildcard SSL	❌ Needs production server setup
What's Missing: Production DNS/SSL configuration (checklist is all unchecked).

LEAD ENGINE - What's Built vs Not

🚀 COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Here's how I would structure this to make Kreateyo beat all platforms:

PHASE 1: Core Functionality (Make It Work)
Set up Resend integration for emails
Configure Flutterwave API for Yopay payments
Fix AI service (correct OpenAI models)
Agora token generation backend
Test domain verification flow
PHASE 2: Lead Generation & Scraping
Add web scraper integration (Replit has one!)
Build Google Maps business scraper
Build LinkedIn profile scraper
Build Instagram/Facebook lead capture
AI-powered lead qualification
Automated AI follow-up sequences
PHASE 3: Growth Features

WhatsApp/SMS notifications (Twilio)
Affiliate/referral program

PHASE 4: Premium Differentiators
AI website builder (generate from prompts)
Competitor price monitoring

Mobile app for business owners
Print-on-demand integration
💡 WEB SCRAPING PLAN FOR LEAD GENERATION
Replit has a Web Scraper blueprint available! Here's how it would work:

Lead Sources to Scrape
Google Maps - Local businesses by category/location
LinkedIn - Professionals and companies
Instagram - Business profiles with contact info
Facebook - Business pages
Yellow Pages - Traditional business directories
Industry directories - Niche websites
Data to Extract
Business name
Email addresses
Phone numbers
Website URLs
Social media profiles
Location/Address
Business category
AI Follow-Up System
Lead Scoring - AI rates leads 1-100 based on potential
Personalized Messages - AI writes custom outreach based on their business
Multi-channel Sequences - Email → Wait 3 days → Follow-up → WhatsApp
Response Detection - AI detects positive/negative responses
Auto-scheduling - Books meetings when lead is interested
Would you like me to create a detailed task list to start implementing these features? I can prioritize based on what will give you the biggest competitive advantage first.

The most impactful order would be:

Resend + Flutterwave (make the platform work)
Web scraping + AI follow-up (unique lead generation)
WhatsApp integration (huge in Africa)
Abandoned cart recovery (boost revenue)
