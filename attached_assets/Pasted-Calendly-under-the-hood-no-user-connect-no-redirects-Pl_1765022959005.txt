Calendly under-the-hood (no user connect / no redirects)

Platform owns Calendly integration. Create a server-side pooled Calendly account (or equivalent scheduler) and manage per-tenant event types programmatically.

For service/consulting tenants auto-create / map event types (duration, buffers, staff availability) into tenant’s Appointments module.

Expose only internal schedule UI: “Create appointment” / “Share booking link” — users never need to connect Calendly. Webhooks handled server-side; bookings sync to Kreateyo calendar.

Frontend ↔ Backend wiring & fixes

Audit and fix all broken routes, buttons, forms, modals, and nested sidebars (payment pages). Ensure pages render correctly on 360×800, 768×1024, 1366×768.

Ensure all frontend actions call versioned backend APIs (OpenAPI). Add loading, success, error, and empty states.

Enforce auth + tenant scoping on every endpoint. Add retry & user-friendly error messages.

Agora HD Calls

Backend: per-tenant Agora token generator, call room lifecycle APIs, call logs, minutes tracking, recording (optional), transcripts storage. Billing hook: track minutes for charging.

Frontend: embedded call UI (mute, video, screen share, chat), start/join buttons in Client Chat, call history. Pro/Enterprise multi-staff support.

Hidden SEO & AI Visibility Engine — Tiered and invisible

Free: automatic Google SEO basics (sitemaps, schema.org, robots, meta tags), crawlable pages, basic structured data. Visible only as metrics.

Pro: everything Free + AI Visibility: generate LLM-friendly business profiles, enriched schema, optimized page snippets, automated indexing submissions where APIs exist. Better “Visibility Score.”

Enterprise: priority AI Visibility: higher-frequency rewrites, multi-channel syndication (search engines + LLM indexes), custom ingestion pipelines, advanced monitoring & tuning.

Rules: never expose engine internals or tools in UI. Only show sanitized results: Visibility Score, traffic uplift, “SEO activity applied.” Collect site & usage data automatically to feed the engine.

Data collection & privacy

Auto-collect tenant website data, page content, product/service metadata, analytics events to feed SEO engine. Store with tenant isolation. Respect opt-outs and data deletion requests (GDPR-like).

Deliverables & tests (must pass)

Frontend PR with screenshots (mobile/desktop) for: Appointment flow, Call UI, Payment page fixes, Theme application, Analytics visibility metrics.

Backend PR with migrations: appointments_templates, calendly_pool, agora_calls, call_minutes, seo_jobs, visibility_scores.

OpenAPI for new endpoints. Background worker setup for scheduling/SEO jobs.

Acceptance checks: Create appointment via platform (no external redirect) → appears in tenant calendar; Start call and record minutes; Free vs Pro vs Enterprise Visibility Score differences; All pages load with no overflow; No dead buttons.
